            <br><br>
            The event was filled with 150 toys and comic booths, and was enlivened by performance of cosplay, idol and anime song performances, and rare toy auctions.

            Head of SACCA Production, Riza Satyagraha, the promoter of this big event, said that since last year's pandemic times, the category of hobbies and toys became the highest-selling categories in the e-commerce. "This motivated us to keep on supporting the Indonesian creative industries by providing them a place to trade, by holding out this event," he added.
            <br><br>
            Riza hoped that his team could inspired more people to keep on supporting the country's creative industries.
